# Principles

1. One Thing  
   Only one active intention at a time.

2. Gentle Friction  
   Small pauses that feel like a breath, not a warning.

3. Completion Has Weight  
   Finishing deserves acknowledgement.

4. No Twitch  
   No jitter, pulsing, or compulsive loops.

5. Depth Over Throughput  
   We measure presence, not volume.

6. Rest Is Structural  
   Pauses are designed, not accidental.
