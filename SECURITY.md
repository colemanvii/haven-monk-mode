# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue.

Instead, email the maintainer with:
- a clear description
- reproduction steps
- impact assessment (what could happen)
- suggested fix if you have one

We will respond as quickly as possible and coordinate a responsible disclosure.
