# Contributing to Haven Monk Mode

This project is intentionally slow.

Before contributing, ask:
- Does this slow the user down?
- Does this reduce cognitive load?
- Does this protect attention?

If unsure, open a discussion first.
Pull requests should explain *why* a change supports Monk Mode.

## Style: Monk Mode

We prefer:
- small PRs
- plain language
- minimal dependencies
- accessibility-first UI
- pacing that can be felt

If your contribution adds speed, stimulation, or complexity, explain why it is necessary.
If it is not necessary, it will not be merged.
